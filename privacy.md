**Last Updated:** 19 May 2025

This privacy policy describes how the X AI Reply Hider Chrome extension handles your data.

## Data Collection and Usage

X AI Reply Hider is designed to enhance your browsing experience on X.com (Twitter) by filtering out unwanted content. **It does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or browsing history.** The extension operates entirely on your local browser, directly modifying the content of the X.com website as you view it.

## Local Storage

The extension uses your browser's local storage to store the following preferences:

* The extension's enabled/disabled state.
* The list of AI bot tags that you wish to block.
* A count of the number of posts hidden by the extension.

This data is stored locally and is not accessible to any external websites or services. It is used solely to ensure that your settings are preserved between browsing sessions.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

* `host_permissions` for `https://x.com/*` and `https://twitter.com/*`: This is required to allow the extension to modify the content of the X.com (Twitter) website to hide posts and replies.
* `storage`: This permission is required to allow the extension to save your settings in your browser's local storage.
* `scripting` and `activeTab`: These permissions are used to inject the `content.js` script into the active X.com (Twitter) tab to perform the filtering.

## Sensitive Information

This extension **does not access, collect, store, or transmit any sensitive user information**, such as:

* Your X.com (Twitter) login credentials.
* Your direct messages.
* Your profile information.
* The content of posts you view (beyond what is necessary to check for blocked tags).
* Your browsing history on other websites.

## Updates

The extension may be updated periodically to improve its functionality, maintain compatibility with X.com (Twitter), or address potential issues. Updates will be carefully reviewed to ensure they do not introduce any new privacy risks.
